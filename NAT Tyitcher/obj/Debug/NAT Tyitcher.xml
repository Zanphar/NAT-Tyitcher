<member name="M:NAT_Tyitcher.GameTCP.AgreeSLA">
 <summary>
 This will prompt the end-user to accept the Software License Agreement (the "SLA") each time the software is executed. 
 They must accept in order to use the software, otherwise it assumes they've said no and won't continue. This can be 
 enabled or disabled, depending if there's a "'" without quotes in AgreeSLA() in the Main Sub. By default, this is 
 enabled.

<member name="M:NAT_Tyitcher.GameTCP.Affinity">
 <summary>
 If you are using Windows 10 or any other Windows version, then you should know about the Process affinity as it will help 
 you better optimize the Processor based on your requirements. If you run a program in Windows, it tends to utilize all the 
 available CPU cores. This is done so that the performance of the program is top-notch.

<member name="M:NAT_Tyitcher.GameTCP.ClockRate">
 <summary>
 In computing, the clock rate or clock speed typically refers to the frequency at which the clock generator of a Processor 
 can generate pulses, which are used to synchronize the operations of its components, and is used as an indicator of the 
 Processor's speed. It is measured in clock cycles per second or its equivalent, the SI unit hertz (Hz).

<member name="M:NAT_Tyitcher.GameTCP.GPUPriority">
 <summary>
 With Windows 10 May 2020 update, we are introducing a new GPU scheduler as a user opt-in, but off by default option. With 
 the right hardware and drivers, Windows can now offload most of GPU scheduling to a dedicated GPU-based scheduling 
 Processor. Windows continues to control prioritization and decide which applications have priority among contexts.

<member name="M:NAT_Tyitcher.GameTCP.NetworkThrottlingIndex">
 <summary>
 Network Throttling Index Windows implements a network throttling mechanism, the idea behind such throttling is that 
 Processing of network packets can be a resource-intensive task. It is beneficial to turn off such throttling for 
 achieving maximum throughput.

<member name="M:NAT_Tyitcher.GameTCP.TCPNoDelay">
 <summary>
 The TCP_NODELAY socket option allows your network to bypass Nagle Delays by disabling Nagle's algorithm, and sending 
 the data as soon as it's available. Enabling TCP_NODELAY forces a socket to send the data in its buffer, whatever the 
 packet size. To disable Nagle's buffering algorithm, use the TCP_NODELAY socket option.

<member name="M:NAT_Tyitcher.GameTCP.LargeSystemCache">
 <summary>
 Large System Cache allows windows to use more RAM for cache thus needing to page to the SSD less often. For older 
 machines this caused issues when RAM was at a premium but for machines with 4GB+ RAM you will only notice performance 
 improvements.

<member name="M:NAT_Tyitcher.GameTCP.SizReqBuf">
 <summary>
 SizReqBuf One of the changes that we can make from the Windows registry to improve Internet speed is through SizReqBuf. 
 Represents the size of the raw receive buffers within a server environment. This means that it can affect when storing 
 something in a high latency environment.

<member name="M:NAT_Tyitcher.GameTCP.DefaultTTL">
 <summary>
 Time to live (TTL) or hop limit is a mechanism which limits the lifespan or lifetime of data in a computer or network. 
 TTL may be implemented as a counter or timestamp attached to or embedded in the data. Once the prescribed event count 
 or timespan has elapsed, data is discarded or revalidated. In computer networking, TTL prevents a data packet from 
 circulating indefinitely. In computing applications, TTL is commonly used to improve the performance and manage the 
 caching of data.

<member name="M:NAT_Tyitcher.GameTCP.IRPStackSize">
 <summary>
 In Microsoft operating systems including Windows NT, Windows 2000 Server, Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, the 
 IRPStackSize is a parameter that specifies the number of stack locations in I/O request packets (IRPs) that are 
 used by the operating system.
