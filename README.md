# NAT-Tyitcher

A small utility that I've never got around to finishing, and decided today to release the source code to the general public. The purpose of this software is to allow one to witch IPv6 servers, and to make other minimal changes. Also includes GameTCP source, which is available at https://github.com/Zanphar/GameTCP.
